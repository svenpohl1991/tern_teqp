Python Code for tracing ternary vapor liquid equlibria using teqp (https://github.com/usnistgov/teqp)

This code is mainly a translation of existing c++ code written by I. H. Bell and was extended to work with N components.
The functionality is to be integrated directly into teqp.

-----
The examples folder contains an exemplary calculation of the ternary VLE of the mixture Carbondioxide - Nitrogen - Methane and
can be compared with the results given in the paper of Sindre Ott√∏y et al. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fluid.2019.112444)
